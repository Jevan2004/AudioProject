# AudioProject
 
# Overview 
This is a simple command-line user interface for playing .wav audio files. 
The user must enter the name of the file with .wav extension, and the program will play the file.
I used the PortAudio library for playing the sound data.

# Work in progress 
Now working on mp3 support, with the help of FFmpeg framework.
